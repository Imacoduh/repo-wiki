# AI/ML Integration for RepoWiki

This section details the integration of AI and ML technologies into RepoWiki, focusing on leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 for content generation and Hugging Face's Transformers for specific AI-driven tasks.

## Integrate OpenAI's GPT-3

To use GPT-3 for generating and updating documentation content, follow these steps:

1. Obtain API Access: Sign up for access to OpenAI's API and obtain your API keys from the OpenAI platform.

2. Install OpenAI SDK: In your backend project, install the OpenAI SDK to interact with GPT-3 easily.

npm install openai

3. Integration Example: Create a function to generate documentation content using GPT-3. Ensure you replace 'your_openai_api_key' with your actual API key.

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function generateDocumentation(prompt) {
  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "text-davinci-003",
    prompt: prompt,
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 2048,
    top_p: 1.0,
    frequency_penalty: 0.0,
    presence_penalty: 0.0,
  });
  return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();
}

## Utilize Hugging Face's Transformers

For tasks like code example generation or query answering, you can use Hugging Face's Transformers library:

1. Install the Transformers library:

pip install transformers

2. Example usage for generating a code example:

from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B')
prompt = "Generate a Python function for a Fibonacci sequence:"
response = generator(prompt, max_length=50, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8)

print(response[0]['generated_text'])

## Develop Custom AI Models or Scripts

For unique features not covered by GPT-3 or Transformers, consider developing custom models or scripts. This might involve using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development and training on specific datasets relevant to your application's needs.

Remember to evaluate the ethical implications and usage policies of AI models and datasets you choose to integrate into your project.
