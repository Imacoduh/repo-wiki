# Deployment Setup for RepoWiki

Ensuring RepoWiki is reliably deployed and maintained involves setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, alongside choosing and configuring hosting solutions for both the frontend and backend components.

## Configure CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines automate the process of testing and deploying your application, ensuring that every change is tested and deployed automatically, reducing the chance for human error and speeding up the deployment process.

1. **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**: Utilize GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. For the backend, create a `.github/workflows/backend.yml` file in your repository with steps to install dependencies, run tests, and deploy to your hosting solution when changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. **Vercel for Frontend Deployment**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel. Vercel automatically deploys your Next.js application upon each push to the main branch, with zero configuration needed for most setups. Ensure your repository settings in Vercel are configured to deploy on push to main.

3. **Heroku or AWS for Backend Deployment**: For Heroku, create a `Procfile` in your backend repository root with the command to start your server, e.g., `web: node server.js`. Connect your GitHub repository to Heroku and set it to auto-deploy the main branch. For AWS, consider using Elastic Beanstalk for an easy-to-configure deployment environment. Use the AWS EB CLI to initialize your application and create an environment to deploy your Express.js application.

## Set Up Hosting

1. **Frontend Hosting on Vercel**: Sign up and log in to Vercel. Import your GitHub repository into Vercel, and it will automatically detect your Next.js project. Vercel provides automatic SSL, global CDN, and scalable hosting out of the box.

2. **Backend Hosting on Heroku**: Sign up and log in to Heroku. Create a new app and connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments. For databases, consider using Heroku Postgres or connecting to a MongoDB Atlas database.

3. **Backend Hosting on AWS**: For more control and scalability, AWS offers services like Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment, RDS for relational databases, and Amazon S3 for storage. AWS requires more setup but offers greater flexibility and scalability options.

By configuring CI/CD pipelines and setting up hosting, you ensure that RepoWiki is automatically tested and deployed, making the development process more efficient and reducing the risk of deployment-related issues.
