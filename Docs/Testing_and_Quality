# Testing and Quality Assurance for RepoWiki

This phase focuses on ensuring the reliability and quality of RepoWiki through comprehensive testing strategies, including unit and integration testing for both frontend and backend components.

## Unit and Integration Testing

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are designed to validate individual pieces of code, such as functions or components, in isolation from the rest of the application. This ensures that each part performs as expected.

1. **Frontend Unit Testing**: For the frontend, consider using Jest alongside Testing Library to test React components. Install the necessary packages:

npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

Create a test file for a component, e.g., `Button.test.js`, and write tests to verify the component renders correctly and responds to user interactions as expected.

2. **Backend Unit Testing**: For the backend, use Jest or Mocha with Chai for testing Express routes and middleware. Install the necessary packages for Mocha and Chai:

npm install --save-dev mocha chai supertest

Write tests in separate files within a `test` directory. Use `supertest` to simulate HTTP requests to your API endpoints and `chai` for assertions.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing ensures that different parts of the application work together seamlessly. This involves testing combinations of units and the interaction between the frontend and backend.

1. **API Integration Testing**: Test the integration between your frontend and backend by making real API requests from the frontend (using libraries like Axios or Fetch API) and verifying the responses.

2. **End-to-End Testing**: Consider using Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing. These tools simulate real user scenarios from opening the application to performing actions like logging in, creating content, and navigating through the site.

To set up Cypress for end-to-end testing:

npm install --save-dev cypress

Add scripts to your `package.json` to open Cypress and run tests:

"scripts": {
  "cypress:open": "cypress open",
  "cypress:run": "cypress run"
}

Write tests in the `cypress/integration` directory to cover critical user flows and ensure the application behaves as expected when all components work together.

By implementing both unit and integration tests, you ensure that individual components function correctly on their own and in combination, significantly reducing the risk of bugs and regressions in RepoWiki.
