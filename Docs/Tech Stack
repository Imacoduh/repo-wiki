Technology Stack
1. Frontend:
Framework: Next.js (React-based framework)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: Redux or Context API for React
2. Backend:
Server Environment: Node.js
Framework: Express.js
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose for object modeling
3. AI/ML Components:
NLP & Content Generation: OpenAI's GPT-3 via the OpenAI API
Alternative for Open Source: Hugging Face's Transformers library for NLP tasks, leveraging models like DistilBERT for content generation and analysis
4. DevOps:
Version Control: Git with GitHub
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Hosting: Vercel (Frontend), Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Backend)
System Architecture Design
The architecture of RepoWiki is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, with a clear separation between the frontend, backend, and AI/ML components.
Frontend Architecture
Directory Structure:
pages/: Contains page components for Next.js routing.
components/: Reusable UI components.
styles/: Tailwind configuration and custom CSS.
store/: Redux store or Context providers for state management.
Key Technologies:
Next.js for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation) capabilities.
Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
Backend Architecture
Directory Structure:
routes/: Express routes for handling API requests.
models/: Mongoose schemas for database models.
controllers/: Business logic for processing requests.
middleware/: Express middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
Key Technologies:
Node.js and Express.js for a lightweight, efficient server.
MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible, schema-based data storage.
AI/ML Integration
Usage:
Integrate GPT-3 for dynamic content creation and updates.
Use Hugging Face's Transformers for tasks not covered by GPT-3 or as an open-source alternative.
Implementation:
Create a separate module or service for handling AI/ML requests to encapsulate the logic and make it reusable across the application.


Commands and File Examples

Initializing the Project
1. Frontend Initialization:
            npx create-next-app@latest frontend
            cd frontend
            npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest --save-dev
            npx tailwindcss init -p
2. Backend Initialization:
            mkdir backend && cd backend
            npm init -y
            npm install express mongoose dotenv
3. AI/ML Setup:
For GPT-3, you'll primarily be interacting with the OpenAI API, so no initial setup in your codebase is required other than securing API keys.
For Hugging Face Transformers:
            pip install transformers


Sample File: Backend Express Setup
File: backend/server.js
            const express = require('express');
            const mongoose = require('mongoose');
            require('dotenv').config();

            const app = express();
            const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

            app.use(express.json());

            // MongoDB Connection
            mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
                .then(() => console.log('MongoDB Connected'))
                .catch(err => console.log(err));

            app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('RepoWiki Backend Running'));

            app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

            
Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory to store sensitive information like your MongoDB URI.
This step sets the foundation for RepoWiki's development, focusing on a modern, open-source stack that balances performance, scalability, and developer experience.
