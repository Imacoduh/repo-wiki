# Performance and Security Testing for RepoWiki

This part of the testing phase is crucial for ensuring that RepoWiki is both performant under load and secure from potential threats. Performance testing checks the application's ability to handle traffic, while security testing identifies vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Use tools like JMeter or Artillery to simulate multiple users accessing the application simultaneously. This helps identify bottlenecks in the application that could affect user experience under heavy load. To get started with Artillery for load testing, install it globally via npm and create a simple test script: npm install -g artillery. Create a load-test.yml file with the following content to simulate 100 users over 60 seconds: config: target: 'http://localhost:3000' phases: - duration: 60 arrivalRate: 100 scenarios: - flow: - get: url: "/". Run the test with: artillery run load-test.yml.

2. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze the results from the load testing to identify any performance issues, such as slow response times or resource bottlenecks. Use this information to optimize the application, potentially by improving database queries, adding caching, or scaling resources.

## Security Testing

1. **Security Audits**: Conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities. Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite can automate the discovery of security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

2. **Address Vulnerabilities**: Prioritize and address the vulnerabilities identified during the audit. This might involve code changes to sanitize inputs, implementing proper authentication and authorization checks, and securing data in transit and at rest.

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities. Use tools like npm audit for Node.js applications to identify and update vulnerable packages.

By performing thorough performance and security testing, you ensure that RepoWiki can handle the expected user traffic and protect against potential security threats, providing a safe and smooth experience for its users.
