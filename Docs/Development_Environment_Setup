To set up the development environment for RepoWiki, particularly focusing on version control with Git and GitHub, follow these steps. This setup is crucial for team collaboration, code versioning, and managing changes efficiently.
Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git on your machine, follow the instructions on the Git website. After installation, configure your Git username and email using the terminal (or command prompt on Windows):
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Sign Up/Login to GitHub: If you don't have a GitHub account, sign up at GitHub. If you already have an account, log in.
2. Create a New Repository:
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub and select "New repository".
Name your repository (e.g., repowiki).
Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
Initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore (Node for a Node.js project), and choose a license if needed.
Click "Create repository".
Step 3: Clone the Repository Locally
Once your GitHub repository is set up, clone it to your local machine to start development:
            git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repowiki.git
            cd repowiki

Step 4: Set Up Branching Strategy
Adopt a branching strategy that suits your project workflow. A common approach is the feature branch workflow, where new features are developed in separate branches and merged into the main branch upon completion.
1. Main Branch: The primary branch where your source code reflects a production-ready state.
2. Develop Branch: Often used as a pre-production branch where all feature branches are merged before being merged into the main branch.
3. Feature Branches: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
Example of creating a feature branch:
            git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

Step 5: Regular Git Workflow
As you develop, use the following Git commands to manage your code:

Add Changes:
            git add .

Commit Changes:
            git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"

Push Changes to GitHub:
            git push origin feature/new-feature-name

Merge Feature Branches (after pull request and code review):
            git checkout develop
            git merge feature/new-feature-name
            git push origin develop

Step 6: Pull Requests
Use GitHub's pull request feature to review code changes in feature branches before merging them into the develop or main branch. This encourages code review and discussion.
Step 7: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Consider setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes. This ensures that your main branch is always deployable and that every change goes through a standardized testing process.
Conclusion
Setting up a robust development environment with Git and GitHub lays the foundation for efficient project management and collaboration. It ensures that your team can work together seamlessly, track changes, and maintain a high-quality codebase for RepoWiki.
