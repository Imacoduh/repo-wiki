Step 1: Wireframes and Mockups
Tools
Figma: An online design tool that's powerful for creating interactive wireframes and mockups. It supports collaboration, making it ideal for team projects.
Adobe XD: Another excellent tool for designing, with support for wireframing, mockups, and prototyping.
Process
1. Define User Flows: Map out the key user journeys to understand the paths users will take when interacting with RepoWiki. This includes actions like searching for documentation, contributing content, and managing user profiles.
2. Sketch Wireframes: Start with low-fidelity wireframes to layout the basic structure of the main pages (e.g., homepage, search results page, article view). Focus on the placement of elements rather than design details.
3. Create Mockups: Transform wireframes into high-fidelity mockups. This is where you add visual details like colors, typography, and UI elements. Ensure consistency across different pages for a cohesive look and feel.
4. Interactive Prototypes: Use Figma or Adobe XD to create interactive prototypes from your mockups. This allows you to simulate user interactions and test the usability of your design.
5. Feedback and Iteration: Share prototypes with potential users and stakeholders to gather feedback. Use insights to refine and iterate on your designs.
Step 2: Implementing the Design
Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS: Utilize Tailwind's utility classes to build a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Focus on mobile-first design, ensuring the interface is usable and accessible on smaller screens.
Accessibility: Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure your web interface is accessible. This includes semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast ratios.
Development Process
1. Setup Tailwind CSS in Next.js:
If not already done during the environment setup, integrate Tailwind CSS with your Next.js project for styling.
2. Component Development:
Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., Navbar, SearchBar, ArticleCard).
Use Next.js pages to assemble components according to your wireframes and mockups.
3. Implementing Accessibility:
Use semantic HTML tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>) for the structure.
Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable with a keyboard.
Add aria-labels where necessary for screen reader support.
4. Responsive Testing:
Use browser developer tools to test your application on various screen sizes.
Consider using tools like BrowserStack for cross-browser testing.
5. User Testing:
Conduct user testing sessions to identify usability issues, especially focusing on responsiveness and accessibility.

Example: Responsive Navbar Component
            import React from 'react';
            import Link from 'next/link';

            const Navbar = () => {
            return (
                <nav className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-gray-800 text-white">
                <Link href="/">
                    <a className="text-xl font-bold">RepoWiki</a>
                </Link>
                <div>
                    <Link href="/about">
                    <a className="px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-700">About</a>
                    </Link>
                    <Link href="/contact">
                    <a className="px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-700">Contact</a>
                    </Link>
                </div>
                </nav>
            );
            };

            export default Navbar;

This step ensures that RepoWiki's user interface is not only visually appealing but also functional, responsive, and accessible, providing a seamless user experience across all devices and accessibility needs.
